# tornedo

Local-first, terminal-native, federated torrent **search** and **download** client.

Search many torrent sites at once, get one clean, ranked, de-duplicated result
set, and download with a fast native engine — all without an account, a cloud,
or any telemetry. State lives in a local SQLite database and survives restarts.

```
tornedo search "dune"          # one federated search, every source
tornedo search "cyberpunk" --json | jq .results
tornedo magnet "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:..."
tornedo                        # terminal UI
```

## Highlights

- **Federated search** — every enabled source runs concurrently with its own
  timeout and fault isolation; a slow or dead source never blocks the others.
  Results stream in as each source settles. Transient failures (timeouts,
  outages, 5xx) are retried once with a short backoff; parse failures never are.
- **Smart results** — titles are parsed into structured metadata (quality,
  codec, audio, HDR, editions, languages, season/episode ranges, game platform
  and version…), identical torrents from different sites are merged, everything
  is deterministically ranked, and releases group by title/year/season with each
  quality as a variant.
- **Intelligent search** — every query is analyzed (media type, title,
  artist/album, year, quality, season/episode) without ever over-asserting: a
  confident parse boosts matching releases and prefers the sources that carry
  that media type; an ambiguous query degrades to a plain search.
- **Fast downloads** — WebTorrent engine behind a thin abstraction, persistent
  queue, resume support, per-torrent and global speed limits, seeding.
- **Crash recovery** — a run marker in the SQLite database tells startup whether
  the previous run ended cleanly. If it crashed, interrupted downloads are
  reconciled (progress preserved, pieces re-verified) and the UI shows exactly
  what was resumed, completed and failed.
- **Terminal UI** — an elegant, component-driven TUI built on **Ink + React**:
  search, results with category/sort/filter controls, live source status,
  details, downloads with a full action menu, and help. Every keybinding is
  configurable and shown on-screen.
- **Headless** — everything the UI can do is available as commands with
  `--json` output.
- **Self-diagnostics** — `tornedo doctor` inspects the config, database,
  download directory, disk space, engine, network, DHT, trackers and sources,
  and reports each check with an actionable fix.
- **Watch mode** — drop `.torrent` or `.magnet`/magnet-URI files into a folder
  and they are added automatically.
- **Private by design** — no accounts, no tracking, no analytics. Config and
  database live on your machine.

## Install & build

Requires Node.js >= 22.

```sh
npm install
npm run build        # compiles TypeScript to dist/
npm run dev -- search "dune"   # run from source without building
```

The CLI entry point is `dist/cli.js`; `npm link` exposes the `tornedo` command.

## Commands

```
tornedo search <query>     Search every enabled source (streams results)
tornedo search <query> --category Music
tornedo downloads          List the queue and active torrents
tornedo magnet <uri>       Add a torrent by magnet URI (waits for completion)
tornedo infohash <hash>    Add a torrent by bare infohash
tornedo file <path>        Add a .torrent file
tornedo watch <dir>        Watch a directory for .torrent / magnet files
tornedo config             Show / set configuration
tornedo sources            List sources and their enabled state
tornedo sources --check    Diagnose Torznab / Internet Archive providers
tornedo doctor             Run self-diagnostics (config, DB, disk, network…)
tornedo doctor --check     Include live endpoint capability probes
tornedo doctor --json      Machine-readable report
tornedo tui                Terminal UI (default when no command)
```

Common flags: `--json` (machine-readable output on stdout only), `--source <id>`
(repeatable), `--category <cat>`, `--limit <n>`, `--dir <dir>`, `--seed` /
`--no-seed`, `--no-wait`, `-q/--quiet`. See `tornedo help`.

## Terminal UI

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑/k` `↓/j` | navigate |
| `enter` / `d` | download selected |
| `D` | download to a chosen directory (then `p`/`r`/`x`/`s`/`m`/`o` manage it) |
| `c` | category scope for the current results |
| `t` | sort order for the current results |
| `ctrl+f` | refine the results with a filter (min/max size, source, resolution, codec, audio, language, quality) |
| `i` | toggle details pane |
| `/` | search again |
| `v` | downloads view |
| `p` / `r` | pause / resume selected download |
| `x` | remove selected download |
| `s` | toggle seeding |
| `m` | action menu for the selected download (cancel, delete files, open folder…) |
| `y` | show selected magnet |
| `o` | open selected magnet in your default handler |
| `?` | help |
| `q` | quit |

Keybindings are configurable under `keybindings` in the config file.

## Sources

Enable/disable any source (`tornedo sources`, then
`tornedo config set sources.<id> true|false`). Built-in adapters: **FitGirl
Repacks** (games), **YTS** (movies), **The Pirate Bay** (movies/TV/music),
**1337x** (movies/TV/music), **LimeTorrents**, **TorrentGalaxy**, and
**TorrentDownloads** (music), **EZTV** (TV), **Nyaa** (anime), **SubsPlease**
(anime), and a **BitTorrented** general feed. Sources that report real swarm
health (seeders) are ranked preferentially.

User-configured providers are first-class sources:

- **Torznab/Newznab** — point at any local indexer (Prowlarr, Jackett, nZEDb,
  …). Tornedo discovers what the endpoint supports (`?t=caps`) and never
  guesses; an endpoint without a `music` capability reports
  `unsupported` instead of returning empty results. Configure under
  `torznabProviders` and verify with `tornedo sources --check`.
- **Internet Archive** — public audio items via the archive.org JSON APIs.
  Only items with downloadable audio files are surfaced. Not a torrent swarm;
  the UI explains why an `ia://` item cannot be queued into the torrent engine.
  Configure under `internetArchive` (disabled by default).

For music searches the robust providers above are the recommended path — the
HTML indexers above are fast-path fallbacks and fail loudly (never silently
empty) when their page structure changes.

## Configuration

`tornedo config` prints the effective config as JSON. Files live at:

- Config: `<config-dir>/tornedo/config.json`
- Database: `<data-dir>/tornedo/tornedo.sqlite` (SQLite, WAL)

Set `TORNEDO_STATE_DIR` to relocate both (also used by the test suite).

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `downloadDir` | where completed data lands |
| `maxActiveDownloads` | concurrent active downloads (`0` = unlimited) |
| `maxDownloadSpeed` / `maxUploadSpeed` | global limits in B/s (`0` = unlimited) |
| `sourceTimeoutMs` | per-source search timeout |
| `sources` | `sourceId -> enabled` map |
| `seedAfterComplete` | default seeding behavior |
| `diskSpaceWarningMb` | minimum free space (MiB) flagged by `tornedo doctor` |
| `recoveryAutoResume` | resume interrupted downloads automatically after a crash |
| `ranking.*` | ranking weights (seeders, quality, health, size) |
| `keybindings.*` | action -> key names (see `tornedo help`) |
| `watchIntervalMs` | watch-mode poll interval |
| `torznabProviders[]` | user-configured Torznab/Newznab endpoints (see below) |
| `internetArchive` | Internet Archive provider settings (below) |

### Torznab providers

`torznabProviders` is an array of objects; each entry adds one source:

```json
{
  "torznabProviders": [
    {
      "id": "prowlarr",
      "name": "Prowlarr",
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:9117/api/v1",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key",
      "enabled": true,
      "categories": ["Music", "Movie", "TV"],
      "timeoutMs": 15000,
      "priority": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | stable id (defaults to `torznab:<index>`) |
| `name` | label shown in source lists |
| `baseUrl` | base URL of the Torznab API (required) |
| `apiKey` | `apikey` query param (empty for open endpoints) |
| `enabled` | participates in searches |
| `categories` | media categories to search (empty = whatever the endpoint reports) |
| `timeoutMs` | per-request timeout (defaults to `sourceTimeoutMs`) |
| `priority` | lower runs first when several providers are configured |

`tornedo sources --check` fetches each endpoint's `?t=caps` and reports which
query modes (`search` / `music` / `movie` / `tv`) it really supports.

### Internet Archive

```json
{ "internetArchive": { "enabled": false, "timeoutMs": 15000, "maxResults": 30 } }
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | participate in searches |
| `timeoutMs` | per-request timeout |
| `maxResults` | max items returned per search |

Enable it with `tornedo config set internetArchive.enabled true`. Nested keys
are settable as dotted paths; add/remove Torznab entries by editing
`config.json` (arrays cannot be appended from the CLI).

## Development

```sh
npm run typecheck    # strict TypeScript, no emit
npm test             # unit + integration (fake sources, no network)
npm run test:bench   # throughput benchmarks
npm run build
```

The test suite never touches your real config or database (`TORNEDO_STATE_DIR`
points at a temp directory). The search engine, download manager, and CLI are
covered end-to-end with fake sources and a fake torrent client.
